## The Value of B2B Thought Leadership Survey Results

https://www.slideshare.net/Grist_Ltd/grist-value-of-b2b-thought-leadership-survey-102649247

We surveyed the C-suite at FTSE 350 firms to find out what they expected from thought leadership, how and when it was consumed, and what would make it better. 

  * Senior executives are positive about thought leadership effects, saying it has importance in: adding value to their role (84%), staying up to speed on key business issues (79%), decision making (76%) and taking a view on the future (76%).

  * Follow-on action: motivated to research the topic in more depth (72%), discuss it with peers or colleagues (67%), implement the suggestions (63%). 

  * Content pros: thoughts of clients (57%), industry experts (53%), professional services firms (44%), the public (42%), peers (36%), and inspirational individuals outside the industry (36%). 

  * Content cons: too generic (63%), lacks original insight or ideas (58%), promotes the advisor rather than addressing client need (53%).

  * Format preferences: short articles of 800 words (63%), blog posts of 300–500 words (57%), feature articles of 1,200+ words (45%), and white papers and research reports of up to 4,000 words (28%), video (26%), audio, (25%), infographics (20%).

  * Top sources: professional services / advisory firms (44%), industry events (43%), and online search (40%).

  * What content would be most useful in the future? 80% said that they wanted content that they – and their peers – were involved in developing. 

  * Monday lunchtimes matter. Two thirds of senior executives seek out thought leadership on a Monday. The two hour slot between 12 noon and 2pm is the single most popular time. 


## Mission.org: The Best Thought Leadership I’ve Ever Seen

1. Present an Arc — With a Transformation, a Journey, or a Conflict. The one thing most publishers should take out of hours of drawn-out literature classes is the universality of the narrative arc. There’s an exposition, rising action, a climax, and falling action to a resolution. This structure is universal because anything else is just boring. Try transformation stories, The Hero’s Journey, Man vs. Man, Man vs. Society, Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Self, etc.

2. Give the Readers Incentive to Read, Deliver Obvious Value. The reason somebody picks up any kind of thought leadership story is to learn something and to apply it. You must deliver obvious value to them and give them an incentive to keep reading. This goes beyond promising a great outcome (more on that below) and goes towards understanding the psychology of the reader. Understand your audience. Flip the script. Paint a dark picture of ignoring your advice. Paint a bright picture of heeding your advice.

3. Paint a Transformative Conclusion and Give them a Promised Land.  After delivering value to your reader, and painting the pictures of your advice, then give your reader something to strive for through the reading. Be as vivid as you can. Engage their imaginations and empathy. Move from the realm of their fears into your world of opportunity.

4. Give Clear Action Items and Make Reading Feel Worthwhile. Action items come in many forms — tools for self-improvement, thought experiments, mental models, and mantras by which to live — and run the gambit from explicit business content to self-help to philosophy. If your readership is expecting something more abstract, give them mental models and psychological tools for thinking about the subject matter in your work. Charts and graphs are fantastic tools for concretizing abstractions.

5. Don’t Feel Bound to a Formula / Treat Your Thought Leadership as A Startup. Take a lesson from the startup world: test, test, test. Use beta readers. Get your content out there early. Get feedback. Understand what works. Do less of what doesn’t. Engage an email list. Publish on a prominent platform. Teach classes and give lectures on the topic. Run a podcast interviewing people on the topic. Write, publish, test, pivot.

## Writing checklist for web content

Priority order:

  * Readers skim. Write sentences that are short, simple, and direct.

  * Readers snip. Write one highlight point per sentence, and per paragraph, and per section.

  * Readers scan. Write to minimize participle phrases, prepositional phrases, subordinate clauses, appositives, litotes, etc.

  * Readers want action. Prefer active verbs vs. passive verbs such as "is", "be", "was".

  * Readers want immediacy. Prefer near (e.g. here and now) vs. far (e.g. there and then).

  * Readers respond to recommendations. Prefer imperative present tense (e.g. "create") vs. past modals such as "should have created", "would have been creating", etc.

  * Readers respond to proof. Prefer substantiation (e.g. direct quotes, statitistics, citations) vs. unsubstantation (e.g. opinions, conjectures, specultations).

  * Readers have a wide range of language skill levels. Favor straightforward words vs. allusion, connotation, innuendo, hyperbole, sarcasm, irony, etc.

  * Readers have a wide range of culture considerations. Favor straightforward meanings vs. allegory, personification, onomatopoeia, pathetic fallacy, etc.
