We surveyed the C-suite at FTSE 350 firms to find out what they expected from thought leadership, how and when it was consumed, and what would make it better. 

  * Senior executives are positive about thought leadership effects, saying it has importance in: adding value to their role (84%), staying up to speed on key business issues (79%), decision making (76%) and taking a view on the future (76%).

  * Follow-on action: motivated to research the topic in more depth (72%), discuss it with peers or colleagues (67%), implement the suggestions (63%). 

  * Content pros: thoughts of clients (57%), industry experts (53%), professional services firms (44%), the public (42%), peers (36%), and inspirational individuals outside the industry (36%). 

  * Content cons: too generic (63%), lacks original insight or ideas (58%), promotes the advisor rather than addressing client need (53%).

  * Format preferences: short articles of 800 words (63%), blog posts of 300–500 words (57%), feature articles of 1,200+ words (45%), and white papers and research reports of up to 4,000 words (28%), video (26%), audio, (25%), infographics (20%).

  * Top sources: professional services / advisory firms (44%), industry events (43%), and online search (40%).

  * What content would be most useful in the future? 80% said that they wanted content that they – and their peers – were involved in developing. 

  * Monday lunchtimes matter. Two thirds of senior executives seek out thought leadership on a Monday. The two hour slot between 12 noon and 2pm is the single most popular time.
